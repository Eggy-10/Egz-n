# 🚀 Git & GitHub Workshop - Mastering the Basics

Welcome to this hands-on Git workshop! This workshop is designed to help you master the fundamental concepts and commands of Git through practical exercises.

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Initialize and configure a Git repository
- Create meaningful commits following industry conventions
- Track changes in your codebase
- Push your work to GitHub
- Understand and use Git's essential commands

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- ✅ Git installed on your computer ([Download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- ✅ A GitHub account ([Sign up here](https://github.com/join))
- ✅ A code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- ✅ Basic command line knowledge

## 🛠️ Essential Git Workflow

Throughout this workshop, you'll use this fundamental workflow:

```bash
git status          # Check what has changed
git add .           # Stage your changes
git commit -m "..."  # Commit with a clear message
git push            # Push to GitHub
```

## 📝 Commit Conventions

Good commit messages are crucial for project maintenance. We follow these conventions:

| Type | Usage | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| `feat:` | New feature or functionality | `feat: add user login form` |
| `fix:` | Bug fix | `fix: resolve null pointer error` |
| `docs:` | Documentation changes | `docs: update README with setup instructions` |
| `style:` | Code formatting, indentation | `style: format code with prettier` |
| `refactor:` | Code improvement without new features | `refactor: simplify validation logic` |
| `chore:` | Miscellaneous tasks | `chore: remove unused files` |

**Format:** `type: brief description in lowercase`

### ✅ Good commit messages:
- `feat: add user profile page`
- `fix: correct typo in homepage title`
- `docs: add installation guide`

### ❌ Bad commit messages:
- `update`
- `fixed stuff`
- `WIP`
- `changes`

## 🎓 Getting Started

- [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/)
- [Git Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Read each instruction carefully** before executing commands
2. **Don't rush** - take time to understand what each command does
3. **Use `git status` frequently** to see what's happening
4. **Ask for help** if you're stuck
5. **Experiment** - Git is safe when you haven't pushed to remote yet!

## 🤝 Need Help?
